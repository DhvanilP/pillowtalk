# Building and Installing pillowtalk

# *Xs

As simple as typing 'make' and 'make install' at the head directory

# Windows

A typical installation will look like (adapated from the YAJL installation
instructions):

1. Click Start > Programs > Microsoft Visual Studio > Visual Studio Tools >
Visual Studio Command Prompt for your version of Visual Studio

  This starts up a Visual studio command prompt. You can check if the compiler
  is in path by typing "cl /?" at the  prompt to check.

2. cd C:\path\to\pillowtalk\source\

3. mkdir build

4. cd build

5. cmake -G"NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

6. nmake

You must have yajl and libcurl installed, and the .dll, .lib, and header files
installed where cmake can find them.  Support for continuous changes feeds
requires pthreads.  This has been tested with the pthread-win32 distribution
(http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/).
