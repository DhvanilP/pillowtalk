# Pillowtalk: CouchDB C API based on libcurl and yajl

This library is a basic wrapper around libcurl and yajl that attempts to
provide a more generic interface to couchdb, mainly communicating via url
targets rather than explicit method calls.  More to come...

See INSTALL for installation instruction on \*X systems and Windows systems.
